# BINARYIF — Master Canonical Document (v1.0)

No irreversible action may occur unless authority has already resolved to TRUE.

BinaryIF is the deterministic authorization layer between intent and execution.

BinaryIF evaluates:
AUTHORIZED(action, evidence, ruleset, context) ∈ { TRUE, FALSE }

BinaryIF emits exactly one artifact:
- PERMIT (TRUE)
- WITHHOLD (FALSE)

BinaryIF is fail-closed and replayable.
